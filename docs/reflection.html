                        <li>While completing these two websites, I was very nervous that it was going to be challenging or that I would not pick up on code quickly. While starting to learn to code in oxygen, I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I was able to pick up the material and the enjoyment that came with designing and coding these websites. Also, working with Wordpress I was able to quickly become acquainted with it.  Some significant challenges that can occur to a new learner and some problems I had came across were pushing your pages to Github. Github can be confusing when you start working with it, especially having to push your website through your terminal on your computer.  Pushing to Github can sometimes cause problems with your layout which I experienced with having issues with my nav bar having continuous errors. Also when putting images in you can have some trouble with blocking your images to where you want them to display on your website. Images also can cause errors if you do not type the correct name that is in your files, with that being said it is important to keep your files organized. Keeping your files organized can lead to everything being significantly easier and not running into as many errors. Skills I feel that are important for creating a website is knowing the basics of what you need. Such as, having your head and body tags, being able to make a CSS stylesheet, being able to understand how to make lists and paragraphs, images along with fig captions. Once you understand and remember what is important to create a website, the second website is created much smoother. Some advantages are being able to learn more about new code and different CSS styles using the website. With all that being said, a couple of skills I would like to improve to make some changes to this website would be using code to make animations throughout my website. Also learning more about CSS styles to better design my wesbite!
