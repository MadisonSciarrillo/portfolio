            <ul>
                <li>The game was created pretty pixelated, I have mixed feelings about the pixel graphics; while I believe the characters get very close to blending in and may only require a little animation, I had trouble finding the monsters to be frightening, and it relies a little too heavily on stick figures. Therefore, this holds the game back from giving a more real world illusion. 
                </li>
                <li>The settings in this game seem to be very simple and not complex. You are able to play one character but it basically controls all four of them. Though I feel like the characters held it back a little because I didn't really have time to bond with them and care about their well-being.  It would have been beneficial to demonstrate that we cannot simply turn around in the first half or so. It's also a little bit overwritten; several scenes, like the bridge Boyd is on near the end, would be better off if the game simply let the setting to speak for itself without the characters interjecting. There are simple “tasks” I guess you could say in the game where the characters are able to look around for these notes or messages. 
                </li>
                <li>In Zero Visibility, you are able to get stuck sometimes in this game with the controls. You are able to control the car in the beginning of the game and occasionally you are able to get the car stuck, which then can lead you to be stuck for a moment or two until you are able to get out of the situation. You make progress in the game by controlling your characters to walk through the snowy mountains and find these notes which leads you more into finding out what can be in the mountains with your characters.
                    </li>
                <li>I see this game can be realistic and can happen to people and probably has. Lots of people go on adventures throughout the  woods or mountains and will tend to get lost or maybe realize they aren't the only ones there and someone else or something can be surrounding them or watching them. 
                </li>
                <li>I think the animation could use a little more development considering the game is based off of stick figures and the quality is more on the pixelated side. 
                </li>
