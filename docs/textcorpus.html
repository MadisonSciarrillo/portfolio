            <p>  The screenshots below are taken to show an analysis of the readings Frankenstein and Stoker Dracula. The Voyant word clusters when compared to each other have many similar
                words including "said", "time", and "like". These 19th century fiction writings are written by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley. Bram Stoker wrote Stoker Dracula and Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. I would classify both these readings as gothic horror. As both seem to be dreary and dark toned. 
                I also found some differences between the textfiles such as theme and the different narration used.</p>

            <h2>Dracula and Frankenstein Word chart comparison</h2>
            <p>Here is what I have to say about this comparison, I see that the authors use similar words throughout their word choice in their writings. Which would make sense because they both are in the category of gothic horror. Below includes the word chart and line graph of similar words used in both.  I can see that the author uses similars words to convey a darker tone for the reader.

            <h2>Frankenstein and Dracula Ngrams</h2>
            <p>I looked into the ngrams for both Frankestein and Stoker-Dracula. I looked up the common words or word stops as they can also be called in digital humanities.  Both readings shared one word being shall which had 99 hits in Frankenstein and 362 in Stoker Dracula.

                    <figcaption> The dangers of science and technology and the conflict between good and evil are common themes in both books, but they are approached differently in each. If "Frankenstein" is more concerned with the effects of unrestrained ambition and the risks of playing god, "Dracula" is more concerned with the fear of the unknown and the threat posed by outsiders to conventional values. Too add, In the two novels, the narrators take on various functions and views. In "Dracula," the protagonists are a team of hunters trying to exterminate the vampire, whereas in "Frankenstein," the story is mostly recounted from Victor Frankenstein's point of view, with sporadic contributions from his creation. </figcaption></figure>
